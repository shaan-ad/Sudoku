<p>In this experiment, you will solve mini Sudoku puzzles.
<p>The rules of Sudoku are to fill in all the digits so that no duplicates
appear in any row, column or bold-bordered square.
<p>This version of the interface uses the mouse <em>and</em> keyboard.
To write a number, type the number on your keyboard or click on a handwritten number on the side,
then click on a square; to activate eraser click on the spacebar.  Click Next or "n" to go to the next puzzle.
<p>Practice on puzzle #1. Then starting with puzzle #2,
solve as many puzzles as quickly and correctly as you can.</div>
